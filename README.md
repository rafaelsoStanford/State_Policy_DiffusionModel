# Leveraging Human Intent for Shared Autonomy and Risk Negotiation

Shared autonomy for transitions from AI to human control of a vehicle. Design of an agent capable identifying human driver behavior and safely transitioning vehicle control.

This is a three-stage project: 
- Trajectory prediction conditioned on human driver behavior.
- Classification of future trajectory as safe/unsafe.
- Finally if safe begin shared control strategy, slowly handing over vehicle control to driver.

## Features
- **Behavior Identification**: The agent is equipped with a diffusion policy model trained on various human driver behaviors, allowing it to make trajectory predictions conditioned on past state observations and driver inputs.

- **Risk Negotiation**: The agent employs risk negotiation strategies to assess potential risks associated with control transitions and make proactive decisions to mitigate them. This ensures that the vehicle operates in a safe and reliable manner.

- **Control Transition**: The system is designed to smoothly transfer control of the vehicle from the AI agent to the human driver. The transition should be smooth after Risk has been evaluated.

- **Diffusion Model Training**: The repository also includes a data generation script that can be used to train diffusion models. These models can be used to model and predict the behavior of human drivers in distinct scenarios.
-> Currently uses a Google Colab implementation which is based on the code of the following work: [Diffusion Policy
Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion](https://github.com/columbia-ai-robotics/diffusion_policy)



## Prerequisites

```

## Usage

- **Data Generation**: In the corresponding folder you will find data generation script which is based on the CarRacing environment by OpenAi Gym. It uses a slightly modified version of `car_racing.py`in order to account for the desired observations. The data is saved using a .zarr structure and consequently as a.zip file, such that it is compatible with the implementation in Google Colab.

- **Diffusion (Colab)**: 
The Colab implementation is based on the image colab repository made by [Diffusion Policy
Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion](https://github.com/columbia-ai-robotics/diffusion_policy) . We replaced the environment to use the CarDriving-v2 from OpenAi **Gymnasium** (which is equivalent to my knowledge to gym==0.26.0). Since Colab switched to Python version 3.10.x the gym==0.21.0 is no longer compatible. Thus we modified the CarRacing environment of Gymnasium. Thus note that there are syntax differences between how `env.` functions are used, compared to our data generation files. 
The environment inputs and outputs have stayed the same, thus the data can still be used. 


- **Experiments**: 
Includes an framework of setting up a controlled Car-Racing environment in gym==0.21.0. This includes:
- [ ] Automated multiple track generation
- [x] Fixed track seeds for reproducability
- [ ] Random controller choice
- [ ] Fixing seed for controller choice
- [x] Move starting line
- [x] Avoid zoom
